# Water quality classification

This is a set of data created from imaginary data of water quality in an urban environment.

**Approach**

1) Importing libraries

2) Reading the concerned dataset

3) Data Understanding

4) Data cleaning

5) Data visualization

6) Splitting the Data and feature scaling

7) Building a various classification models like ("glm","rf","svm","xgb","Ada boost")

8) Making Predictions Using the Models

9) Model Evaluation using Confusion matrix

10) Choosing the best model interms of ROC and AUC curve

**Conclusion**

Out of the all Models Random forest gives the **high roc_auc_score: 0.854**
